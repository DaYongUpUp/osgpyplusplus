Build boost
On windows:
  Open Visual Studio command prompt
  Change directory to boost source tree
  % bootstrap
  % b2 --with-python python-debugging=off threading=multi variant=release link=shared toolset=msvc-9.0 install

Set GCCXML_COMPILER environment variable to the correct value (msvc9 on Windows for Python 2.7)
