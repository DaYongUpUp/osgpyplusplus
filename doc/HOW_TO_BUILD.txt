Install CMake (maybe version 2.8)

On windows:
  Install Visual Studio 9/2008 (or whatever your version of python requires)

Build and install Boost
On windows:
  Open Visual Studio command prompt
  Change directory to boost source tree
  % bootstrap
  % b2 --with-python python-debugging=off threading=multi variant=release link=shared toolset=msvc-9.0 install

Install ColladaDOM (to be able to load Collada DAE files in OSG)

Build and install OpenSceneGraph
  Enable collada plugin and point to the correct colladadom library
  Do NOT check COLLADA_USE_STATIC; sadly, collada loading does not work that way.

If you will be modifying and rebuilding the OSG/C++/Python bindings:
  Install GCCXML
  Set GCCXML_COMPILER environment variable to the correct value (msvc9 on Windows for Python 2.7)
  install pygccxml python module
  install pyplusplus python module

[Many more steps need to be documented here...]
